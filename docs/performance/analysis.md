## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Common Performance Problems

#### Slow Processing
**Symptoms**: Operations taking >5 minutes for <10k resources
**Causes**:
- Large file sizes without streaming parser
- Insufficient memory causing swap usage
- Network latency for remote state files
- Concurrent operations exceeding system capacity

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Enable streaming parser
wgo scan --streaming=true --large-files

# Increase memory limits
export VAINO_MEMORY_LIMIT=4GB

# Reduce concurrency
export VAINO_MAX_WORKERS=4

# Use local state copy
wgo scan --local-copy=true
```

#### High Memory Usage
**Symptoms**: Memory usage >2GB for normal operations
**Causes**:
- Memory leaks in long-running processes
- Too many concurrent operations
- Large diff operations without optimization

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Enable memory profiling
wgo scan --memory-profile=true

# Limit concurrent operations
wgo scan --max-concurrent=4

# Use incremental diffs
wgo diff --incremental=true
```

#### Watch Mode Issues
**Symptoms**: High CPU usage or delayed change detection
**Causes**:
- Too frequent polling
- Watching too many files
- Inefficient change detection

**Solutions**:
```yaml
# Optimize watch configuration
watch:
  poll_interval: 1s        # Reduce frequency
  batch_changes: true      # Group changes
  ignore_patterns:         # Exclude irrelevant files
    - "*.tmp"
    - "*.lock"
```

### Performance Debugging Tools

#### Built-in Profiling
```bash
# CPU profiling
wgo scan --cpu-profile=cpu.prof

# Memory profiling  
wgo scan --memory-profile=mem.prof

# Trace analysis
