# Homebrew Tap for WGO

This directory contains the template for the Homebrew tap repository that will be created at `github.com/yairfalse/homebrew-wgo`.

## Structure

When GoReleaser publishes a new release, it will:

1. Create/update a repository at `github.com/yairfalse/homebrew-wgo`
2. Generate a Formula file based on the template
3. Update the formula with the latest version and checksums

## Manual Tap Setup (if needed)

If you need to manually create the tap repository:

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `homebrew-wgo`
2. Create a `Formula` directory
3. GoReleaser will handle the rest during releases

## Testing Locally

To test the formula locally before release:

```bash
# Create local tap
mkdir -p $(brew --prefix)/Homebrew/Library/Taps/yairfalse
cd $(brew --prefix)/Homebrew/Library/Taps/yairfalse
git clone https://github.com/yairfalse/wgo homebrew-wgo

# Install from local tap
brew install yairfalse/wgo/wgo
```

## Formula Template

The formula is automatically generated by GoReleaser using the configuration in `.goreleaser.yml`.
