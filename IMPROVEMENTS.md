# WGO Usability Improvements

## What We Fixed

### 1. **Spoon-Feeding Error Messages**
Every error now tells users EXACTLY what to do:

- **GCP Auth Errors**: 
  - Detects if gcloud is installed
  - Shows exact commands to copy/paste
  - Offers automatic fixes with `wgo auth gcp`
  - Even detects OS and shows platform-specific install commands

- **AWS Auth Errors**:
  - Checks for AWS CLI and existing profiles
  - Shows exact environment variables to set
  - Provides direct links to get credentials
  - Platform-specific install instructions

### 2. **Helpful "Getting Started" Messages**
Instead of cryptic errors, users now see:

- **No provider detected**:
  ```
  👋 Welcome to WGO!
  
  🎯 QUICK START - Choose your provider:
  
    For Terraform projects:
      wgo scan --provider terraform
  
    For Google Cloud:
      wgo scan --provider gcp --project YOUR-PROJECT-ID
  ```

- **No snapshots/baselines**:
  ```
  ❌ No Baselines Found
  
  🎯 DO THIS NOW:
  
    1. Scan your infrastructure:
       wgo scan --provider terraform
    
    2. Create a baseline:
       wgo baseline create --name prod-baseline
    
    3. Then check for drift:
       wgo check
  ```

### 3. **Made Claude API Optional**
- WGO now works perfectly without AI setup
- Only needed for `wgo explain` command
- No more "Claude API key required" errors

### 4. **Authentication Helper**
New `wgo auth` commands make setup easy:
- `wgo auth gcp` - Interactive GCP setup
- `wgo auth aws` - Interactive AWS setup  
- `wgo auth status` - Shows what's configured
- `wgo auth test` - Tests authentication

### 5. **Action-Oriented Messages**
Every error includes:
- ✅ What's working
- ❌ What's broken
- 🎯 EXACT commands to fix it
- 💡 Helpful tips
- 🚀 Easiest solution first

## Examples

### Before:
```
Error: failed to create GCP client: google: could not find default credentials
```

### After:
```
❌ GCP Authentication Failed

✅ Good news: You have gcloud installed and are logged in!
   Account: user@example.com

🎯 DO THIS RIGHT NOW (copy and paste):

   gcloud auth application-default login

   (This will open your browser. Just click 'Allow')

📋 Then run this command:
   wgo scan --provider gcp --project YOUR-PROJECT

🚀 EVEN EASIER - Let WGO do it for you:
   wgo auth gcp
   (This will handle everything automatically)
```

## The Result

Users can now:
1. Understand exactly what went wrong
2. Copy/paste commands to fix issues
3. Use `wgo auth` for automatic setup
4. Get platform-specific instructions
5. See tips at every step

Everything is mega easy and spoon-feeding!
