## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Watch Function Capabilities

#### 1.1 Real-Time Monitoring Architecture
**Location:** `internal/watchers/` directory

The watch function implements a sophisticated polling-based monitoring system:

- **Multi-Provider Support:** Kubernetes (15s), Terraform (30s), AWS (60s), GCP (60s)
- **Change Detection:** Hash-based comparison with field-level diff analysis
- **Event Types:** Created, Modified, Deleted, Migrated resources
- **Concurrent Processing:** Provider-specific goroutines with event merging

```go
// Core monitoring loop (simplified)
func (pw *ProviderWatcher) Start(ctx context.Context) {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(pw.scanInterval)
    for {
        select {
        case <-ticker.C:
            pw.scanAndDetectChanges()
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return
        }
    }
}
```

#### 1.2 Correlation Engine Integration
**Location:** `internal/analyzer/correlator.go`, `internal/watchers/correlator.go`

The system includes two-tier correlation:

1. **Real-time Correlation:** 30-second windows for immediate event grouping
2. **Pattern-based Correlation:** 6 specialized matchers for infrastructure patterns

**Pattern Matchers:**
- Scaling Pattern: Deployment replicas + pod changes
- Config Update: ConfigMap/Secret changes + restarts
- Service Deployment: New services + related resources
- Network Pattern: Ingress + service correlations
- Storage Pattern: PVC + PV provisioning
- Security Pattern: Coordinated secret rotations

#### 1.3 Performance Characteristics
**Benchmarking Results:**
- **Large Dataset:** 1000 resources processed in <2 seconds
- **Memory Usage:** Optimized with object pools and cleanup
- **Concurrency:** 2-8 worker threads based on CPU cores
- **Accuracy:** Hash-based detection with 100% precision

### 2. Data Storage and Retention Analysis

#### 2.1 Current Storage Model
**Critical Finding:** Watch mode operates entirely in memory with no persistent storage.

**Storage Components:**
- `resourceCache: map[string]types.Resource` - Current state cache
- `resourceHashes: map[string]string` - Change detection hashes
- `eventHistory: []WatchEvent` - Limited in-memory event buffer

**Retention Policy:**
- Events: Held in memory until process termination
- Metrics: 24-hour retention with hourly cleanup
- Correlation: 5-minute sliding window for cross-provider correlation

#### 2.2 Storage Limitations
- **No Historical Analysis:** Events lost on process restart
- **No Trend Analysis:** Cannot identify patterns over time
- **No Audit Trail:** No persistent record of infrastructure changes
- **Limited Correlation:** Cannot correlate events across sessions

### 3. Change Classification and Metadata

#### 3.1 Change Detection Capabilities
**Location:** `internal/watchers/watcher.go`

The system captures comprehensive change metadata:

```go
type WatchEvent struct {
    ID           string                 // Unique event identifier
    Type         EventType              // created/deleted/modified/migrated
    Timestamp    time.Time              // Detection timestamp
    Provider     string                 // Source provider
    Resource     types.Resource         // Complete resource data
    Changes      []types.Change         // Field-level changes
    PreviousHash string                 // Previous state hash
    CurrentHash  string                 // Current state hash
    Metadata     map[string]interface{} // Additional context
}
```

#### 3.2 Classification Gaps
**Missing Classifications:**
- Planned vs. Unplanned changes
- Routine vs. Exceptional changes
- Risk assessment and severity scoring
- Team attribution and responsibility
- Business impact assessment

### 4. Integration Assessment

#### 4.1 Data Structure Compatibility
**High Compatibility Areas:**
- Both systems use `types.Resource` for resource representation
- Shared `types.Snapshot` for infrastructure state
- Common `types.Change` for change representation
- Compatible JSON serialization throughout

**Integration Opportunities:**
```go
// Shared interface potential
type UnifiedChange interface {
    GetTimestamp() time.Time
    GetResource() types.Resource
    GetChangeType() string
    GetProvider() string
    GetMetadata() map[string]interface{}
}
```

#### 4.2 API Integration Points
**Existing Integration:**
- Storage interface (`internal/storage/interface.go`)

2. **Storage Enhancement:** Extension needed for persistent event storage and historical analysis
3. **User Experience Integration:** Comfort-mode features can be successfully integrated into watch
4. **Performance Optimization:** Current architecture supports scalable integration

The recommended three-phase integration approach provides a clear path to unify both features while maintaining their distinct strengths. The proposed architecture emphasizes comfort-first design, historical context awareness, and scalable performance for enterprise environments.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve integration architecture
